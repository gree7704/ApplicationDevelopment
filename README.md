This is for comments on my Programming Assignment 3

Reviewer 1: There are three areas in the code with error bubbles. There is a missing semi colon at line 90, 95, and 96. The app.js file wouldn't run on my emulator, but that could completely be because of my computer and my emulator. It really only works and runs fully functional code about 40% of the time. Navigation between two windows seems to be a tab, and a button to show the camera, which is the gadget chosen for this app. Code for the camera seems to be the same code I used out of the book, but I had to add semi colons that were not in the book to my text in order to make it functional, and that is what your code is missing.
